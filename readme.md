A mock-up of an agency site made from a free PSD provided here: http://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/tajam-psd-website-template-for-agencies/

As this is only a mock-up and not for an actual client, my goal for this was to closely simulate an environment in which a designer hands me a PSD to slice and replicate on the web. In other words, practice! However, no mobile styles were provided and no additional media for functionality. I ended up just implementing my own mobile styles so that it could be responsive.

I'm content that I got some practice in with SMACSS/BEM (first time). Thanks to these CSS methodologies, if I ever feel the need to refactor some CSS on this page at a later time, it should be a breeze. If this were for an actual client, I'd surely want to revisit a few things. Sprites being one to greatly reduce the amount of HTTP requests.
